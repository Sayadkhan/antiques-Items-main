      <p>
        An antique is an item perceived as having value because of its aesthetic
        or historical significance, and often defined as at least 100 years old,
        although the term is often used loosely to describe any object that is
        old.Vintage and collectible are used to describe items that are old, but
        do not meet the 100-year criterion
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people collect antiques because those items hold sentimental value.
        Some people hold on to antique items that are passed on to them by their
        family for three generations or more because of their sentimental value.
